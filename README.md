# ‚è±Ô∏è Time Series Forecasting Model Comparison

This repository contains multiple time series forecasting models implemented using the same dataset to compare their performance and forecast accuracy. The primary goal is to identify which model performs best for energy demand forecasting using historical data.

## üß† Models Implemented

1. **ARIMA** ‚Äì Traditional statistical model for forecasting.
2. **SARIMA** ‚Äì Seasonally adjusted ARIMA.
3. **RNN** ‚Äì Basic recurrent neural network.
4. **LSTM** ‚Äì Deep learning-based model suited for long-term dependencies.
5. **GRU** ‚Äì Similar to LSTM but more computationally efficient.

## üìä Objective

- Use the same dataset (`PJME_hourly.csv`) across all models.
- Train, validate, and compare results.
- Analyze forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Determine which model provides the best real-world performance for energy demand prediction.

## üìå Key Results

- Performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and visual plots were used to evaluate each model.
- Deep learning models (LSTM and GRU) handled long-term patterns better.
- ARIMA/SARIMA performed well with fewer resources but struggled with seasonality compared to deep learning models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statsmodels (for ARIMA/SARIMA)
- TensorFlow / Keras (for RNN, LSTM, GRU)
- Google Colab
